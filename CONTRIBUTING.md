# How to Contribute

We are excited that you are interested in contributing! This document outlines the standards and procedures for contributing to this project.

## GitHub Flow

We follow the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) process:
1.  Create an Issue and get it assigned to you.
2.  Create a new branch from `main` named `type/issue-number/short-description` (e.g., `feat/42/add-new-button`).
3.  Do your work and commit your changes.
4.  Push your branch and open a Pull Request.
5.  Wait for a review and approval.
6.  Merge the Pull Request.

## Commit Message Convention

We use **Conventional Commits**. This helps us maintain a clear and semantic commit history. Each commit message should follow this structure:

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature.
- `fix`: A bug fix.
- `docs`: Documentation only changes.
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc).
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries.

**Example:**
`docs: add foundational repository files`
